## Pool-Boy

This program fetches a swimming pool tickets from the Berliner BÃ¤der Betriebe. I always had a hard time to book a time-slot from the website because other customers were faster to reserved a ticket for the pool.   
But now with the help of "pool-boy" you can easily get a ticket to you favorite pool in Berlin.
