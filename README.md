## Pool-Boy

This program fetches swimming pool tickets from the Berliner BÃ¤der Betriebe. I always had a hard time to book a time-slot from the website because other customers were faster to reserve a ticket for the pool.
But now with the help of "pool-boy" you can easily get a ticket to your favorite pool in Berlin.
